    "The following code presents my first ever Python project from my college days. This mini project boasts lack of coding knowledge at the time of production, as you would find the following drawbacks:\n",
    "* Only capital letter entries for grades work in this calculator.\n",
    "* There are no prompts for users to re-input values after entering invalid values.\n",
    "* Following the point above, you would have to start the calculator again and input correct values.\n",
    "* Many more issues that real programmers can point out and roast me with.\n",

    "After gaining a little more coding knowledge, you will find these issues fixed in my **GPA 2.0** code :)"
